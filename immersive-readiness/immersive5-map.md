## Exercises

```js
function each(coll, f) {
  if (Array.isArray(coll)) {
    for (var i = 0; i < coll.length; i++) {
      f(coll[i], i);
    }
  } else {
    for (var key in coll) {
      f(coll[key], key);
    }
  }
}

function map(array, f) {
  var acc = [];
  each(array, function(element, i) {
    acc.push(f(element, i));
  });
  return acc;
}
```

### Basic Requirements

1. We can rewrite the `ages` function from the warmup using `map` like this:

   ```js
   var people = [
     {name: {first: "Alyssa", middle: "P.", last: "Hacker"}, age: 26},
     {name: {first: "Ben", last: "Bitdiddle"}, age: 34},
     {name: {first: "Eva", middle: "Lu", last: "Ator"}, age: 40},
     {name: {first: "Lem", middle: "E.", last: "Tweakit"}, age: 45},
     {name: {first: "Louis", last: "Reasoner"}, age: 21}
   ];

   function ages(people) {
     return map(people, function(person) {
       return person.age;
     });
   }
   ```

   Rewrite the functions `firstNames`, `lastNames` and `fullNames` using `map`
   as shown above.

2. Given the function `abs` that computes the absolute value, finish the
   invocation of `map` that should compute the absolute value of each number in
   its array argument.

   ```js
   function abs(x) {
     if (x >= 0) {
       return x;
     }
     return -x;
   }

   map([1, -2, 37, -100, -8, 5], ???);
   // => [1, 2, 37, 100, 8, 5]
   ```

   **HINT:** To test this, it may be easiest to paste all of the above into a
   console.

3. We're going to write a function `maximums` that, given an *array of arrays of numbers*
   as an argument, returns a new array containing the maximum number of each
   inner array. That's a bit of a mouthful, so let's break it down:

   ```js
   // our argument would look like this:
   var sampleInput = [ // it's an array
     [1, 3, 2], // of arrays of numbers
     [4, 23, 100],
     [7, 6, 3, -2]
   ];

   // and we want to be able to use maximums to do this:
   maximums(sampleInput); // => [3, 100, 7]
   ```

   **Part One:** Let's start by writing a function `max` that, when given an
   *array of numbers* computes the maximum number in that array. You will want
   to use `each` for this.

   ```js
   function max(numbers) {
     // YOUR CODE HERE
   }
   max([1, 3, 2]); // => 3
   max([4, 23, 100]); // => 100
   ```

   **Part Two:** Now that you have a function that computes the the maximum
   number in an array of numbers, use `map` to transform each array in
   the `sampleInput` into its maximum by completing the `maximums` function:

   ```js
   function maximums(arrays) {
     return // YOUR CODE HERE
   }
   ```

### More Practice

1. Complete the function `exponentials` that accepts an array of numbers as a
   parameter, and raises each number `n` to the `n`th power, *e.g*:

   ```js
   function exponentials(numbers) {
     // YOUR CODE HERE
   }
   exponentials([1, 2, 3, 4]); // => [1, 2*2, 3*3*3, 4*4*4*4] => [1, 4, 27, 256]
   exponentials([3, 2, 5]); // => [27, 4, 3125]
   ```

2. First, write a function `reverse` that accepts a string as a parameter and
   returns a reversed version of that string (you'll want to use a `for` loop
   for this). Then, use `reverse` to write a function called `reverseWords` that
   accepts a string as an argument, and returns a string with all of its words
   reversed. You'll want to use `split` and `join` in both of these functions.

   ```js
   "hello".split(""); // => ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
   ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"].join(""); // => "hello"

   "hello world".split(" "); // => ["hello", "world"]
   ["hello", "world"].join(" "); // => "hello world"

   reverseWords("hello world"); // => "olleh dlrow"
   ```

   Note that `reverseWords` should reverse **each word individually**, not the
   entire string.

3. We often want to transform an array of objects by looking up the value found
   under a specific key in each object; for instance, consider the problem of
   finding the ages of all the people in the `people` array like we did in the
   first exercise:

   ```js
   var people = [
     {name: {first: "Alyssa", middle: "P.", last: "Hacker"}, age: 26},
     {name: {first: "Ben", last: "Bitdiddle"}, age: 34},
     {name: {first: "Eva", middle: "Lu", last: "Ator"}, age: 40},
     {name: {first: "Lem", middle: "E.", last: "Tweakit"}, age: 45},
     {name: {first: "Louis", last: "Reasoner"}, age: 21}
   ];

   function ages(people) {
     return map(people, function(person) {
       return person.age;
     });
   }
   ```

   Write a function called `pluck` that takes an array of objects and a string
   representing a key as parameters, and returns an array of all the values
   found under each object using the key, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   pluck(people, "age"); // => [26, 34, 40, 45, 21]
   ```

   Your implementation should use `map`.

4. Let's say that we have a string representing a CSV (comma-separated values) file
   that looks like this:

   ```js
   "Alyssa,P.,Hacker,26\nBen,,Bitdiddle,34\nEva,Lu,Ator,40\nLem,E.,Tweakit,45\nLouis,,Reasoner,21"
   ```

   And we want to parse it into an array **people** objects like we showed in
   the warmup, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   var people = [
     {name: {first: "Alyssa", middle: "P.", last: "Hacker"}, age: 26},
     {name: {first: "Ben", last: "Bitdiddle"}, age: 34},
     {name: {first: "Eva", middle: "Lu", last: "Ator"}, age: 40},
     {name: {first: "Lem", middle: "E.", last: "Tweakit"}, age: 45},
     {name: {first: "Louis", last: "Reasoner"}, age: 21}
   ];
   ```

   Using `map` and `split`, write a function `parseCSV` that accepts a CSV
   string as a parameter and outputs an array of people objects with the *exact*
   format as shown above.

### Advanced

1. **Disclaimer: This problem is very difficult!** Write a function called
   `map2` that accepts **two** arrays and a function as arguments, and
   constructs a new array by invoking its function argument on the elements of
   both arrays, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   map2([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], function(a, b) {
     return a * b;
   });
   // => [4, 10, 18]
   ```

   Now, write a function called `mapN` that accepts an *arbitrary number of
   arrays* and a `n`-ary function as arguments, and constructs a new array by
   combining the elements of all the arrays, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   mapN([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [2, 2, 2], function(a, b, c) {
     return (a * b) + c;
   });
   // => [6, 12, 20]

   mapN([1, 2, 3], function(x) { return x * x; }) // => [1, 4, 9]
   ```

   You'll need to read about the `arguments` keyword and `apply` to complete
   this function.
